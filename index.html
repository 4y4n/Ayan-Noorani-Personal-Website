                    Hi, I'm <span>Ayan Noorani.</span> <br/>
                    A high school student.
                </h1>
                <p>
                    I am currently a student in the IB program, entering grade 12 at Milliken Mills High School.  In addition to my studies, I work part-time at Code Ninjas Markham as a programming instructor where I teach young kids how to code using javascript. When I step away from the computer, you'll often find me embarking on day trips, trail biking and exploring new paths. I also really enjoy listening to music, with indie and rock with indie and rock being my personal favourite genres. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    I also have an interest in urban planning, as I took the initiative to establish and lead a school-based club centered around this. This club is currently working closely with the school board and the city towards improving student safety around the school. At the moment, I am actively working on improving my web development skills, with a specific focus on getting more comfortable with JavaScript.

                    <h1>ZoomMate</h1>
                    <p>ZoomMate is a program I created that fully automates the process of attending Zoom meetings. It allows users to input their meeting details such as start times, end times, Zoom links and days active into a master json file. I used python’s webbrowser library to open the Zoom meetings with the links at the specified start times, automatically joining the meetings. To exit the meeting once they conclude, the Zoom application is killed. ZoomMate is able to handle multiple meetings occurring on different days throughout the week as it references the days that the meeting is active before attending each one.</p>

                    <h1>Fruity Facts</h1>
                    
                    <p>This was a creative collaboration between a group of friends that uses machine learning (ML) techniques. By simply providing an image of a fruit, Fruity Facts harnesses a trained ML model built on the TensorFlow framework to identify the given fruit. We trained the ML model on tens of thousands of fruit images, fine-tuning it through seven iterations. As a result the model was successfully built with an accuracy rate of 99.8%. The program then calls the Edamam API, enabling users to access comprehensive nutritional information for the identified fruit. It displays the exact composition, vitamins, minerals, and other essential nutrients with a single click.</p>

                    <p>This program uses the sqlite3 Python library, this tool queries the user’s local browser database, extracting tons of information. This includes records of every website the user has visited, along with the corresponding date and time of each visit, as well as the duration spent on each site. The program then parses through the URLs and calculates the frequency of each domain, generating comprehensive visit counts. The program can then display the results in a textual format, or in a graphical format. It uses Python’s matplotlib module to graph the user’s top 10 most frequently visited websites.</p>

<!-- have a main page with an image carousel, a nice title at the top right with my description below that. then three identical buttons containing resume, github, projects, have projects button take you below. -->
<!-- have a button at the top right where when pressed, will change the css variables to change theme of page -->
<!-- for carousel, have each picture in a div with 100% width that are all in a div with 400% width that is in a div with 100% so you only see one pic at a time, in javascript, just slide the 400% width div over! -->
