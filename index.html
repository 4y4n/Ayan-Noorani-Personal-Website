                    Hi, I'm <span>Ayan Noorani.</span> <br/>
                    A high school student.
                </h1>
                <p>
                    
                    I am currently a student in the IB program, entering grade 12 at Milliken Mills High School. As an enthusiastic learner, I am passionate about various aspects of STEM, including math, coding, and engineering. I also work part-time at Code Ninjas Markham as a programming instructor where I teach young kids to code using javascript. 
                    </br></br>
                    When I'm not immersed in the world of programming, you can find me out for day trips with my dad enthralling in trail biking. I also enjoy music very much, with a particular fondness for indie and rock genres.

                    <h1>ZoomMate</h1>
                    <p>ZoomMate is a program I created that fully automates the process of attending Zoom meetings. It allows users to input their meeting details such as start times, end times, Zoom links and days active into a master json file. I used pythonâ€™s webbrowser library to open the Zoom meetings with the links at the specified start times, automatically joining the meetings. To exit the meeting once they conclude, the Zoom application is killed. ZoomMate is able to handle multiple meetings occurring on different days throughout the week as it references the days that the meeting is active before attending each one.</p>

                    <h1>Fruity Facts</h1>
                    
                    <p>This was a creative collaboration between a group of friends that uses machine learning (ML) techniques. By simply providing an image of a fruit, Fruity Facts harnesses a trained ML model built on the TensorFlow framework to identify the given fruit. We trained the ML model on tens of thousands of fruit images, fine-tuning it through seven iterations. As a result the model was successfully built with an accuracy rate of 99.8%. The program then calls the Edamam API, enabling users to access comprehensive nutritional information for the identified fruit. It displays the exact composition, vitamins, minerals, and other essential nutrients with a single click.</p>

<!-- have a main page with an image carousel, a nice title at the top right with my description below that. then three identical buttons containing resume, github, projects, have projects button take you below. -->
<!-- have a button at the top right where when pressed, will change the css variables to change theme of page -->
<!-- for carousel, have each picture in a div with 100% width that are all in a div with 400% width that is in a div with 100% so you only see one pic at a time, in javascript, just slide the 400% width div over! -->
